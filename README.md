# Peer Graded Assignment-The Battle Of Neighborhood

# 1) Introduction/Business Problem : 
The Aim of the project is to help people who are planning to open a new restaurant in Toronto, To choose a location by providing data about the income and population of each neighborhood as well as the competitors already present on the same area.


# 2) Data :
To provide the stakeholders the necessary information I'll be combining Toronto's 2016 Census that contains Population, Average income per Neighborhood with Foursquare API to collect competitors on the same neighborhoods.

Toronto's Census data in publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#8c732154-5012-9afe-d0cd-ba3ffc813d5a
 
Toronto Neighborhoods' shapefile is publicly available at this website: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/#a45bd45a-ede8-730e-1abc-93105b2c439f

# 3) Methodology :
For this problem I used a few different maps that could help a new investor to decide the best neighborhood to open a restaurant in Toronto based on it's income, population and available competitors. In order to do that I've used the 2016 Census information combined with choropleth maps to visually display the wealthier and more populational neighborhoods and Foursquare data to display the current restaurants in each region.

# 4) Results :
By observing the data we can notice the majority of the restaurants grouped on main streets and on the south of the city, although some of the welthiest neighborhoods are up to the north. Also, the areas with a dense population don't reflect on the number of restaurants.

# 5) Discussion :
I recommend that places with high population density and high income will be suitable to keep a new restaurant in Toronto

# 6) Conclusion :
This report will be helpful to those people who want to start their business in Toronto, By comparing the neighborhood restaurant profiles and current offers,Although it didnt cover many aspects like Transportation or even the reviews of the restaurant which are already present in that area.This report will be helpful for some extent to helip in business.
